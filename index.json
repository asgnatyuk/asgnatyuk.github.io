It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.\nJava was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems\u0026#39; Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. History James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling’s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.\nPrinciples There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:\nIt must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar. It must be robust and secure. It must be architecture-neutral and portable. It must execute with high performance. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic. Syntax The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).\nUnlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces. Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE. All source files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix .java, for example, HelloWorldApp.java. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file with the .class suffix (HelloWorldApp.class, in this case). Only then can it be executed or launched. The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier and any number of public inner classes. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make one class (introduced by the class keyword) public (preceded by the public keyword) and name the source file with that public class name. A class that is not declared public may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with .class appended. For class file generation, anonymous classes are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a $, and an integer. The keyword public denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name …","date":1653754340,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653754340,"objectID":"52a4350d79604320e7eea8ed5e9d56f7","permalink":"https://asgnatyuk.github.io/post/java/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T19:12:20+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/java/","section":"post","summary":"Java Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.\nHeadings To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three , use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).\nAlternate Syntax Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or – characters for heading level 2.\nHeading Best Practices Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name\nParagraphs To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.\nLine Breaks To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.\nBold To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.\nItalic To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.
